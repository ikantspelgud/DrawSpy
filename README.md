# DrawSpy
DrawSpy is a web application for a group hidden role drawing game.

The application distributes the same word to all players except one. Players take turns drawing one line until the player who doesn't know the word (the spy) guesses what is being drawn, or a majority of the players accuse a player. If the spy guesses correctly they win; otherwise they lose. If the majority of players accuse the spy, the spy loses, otherwise the spy wins immediately.
